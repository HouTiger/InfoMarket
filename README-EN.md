# Information Market
It's a prediction market game website written by [Taige Hou](https://houtiger.github.io/) for the course ***"Computational Thoughts and Methods in Social Science"*** at Peking University, taught by [Prof. Xiaoming Li](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1424/7020.htm). 
The idea comes from [Teaching with Networks, Crowds and Markets](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ladamic/courses/networks/si301w11/teaching/), it's a complementary in-class activity game for ***"Chaper 22: Markets and Information"*** of the book ***"Networks, Crowds and Markets"*** by **David Easley** and **Jon Kleinberg**.  
The code is allowed for using in teaching activities freely.  
Enjoy it!
